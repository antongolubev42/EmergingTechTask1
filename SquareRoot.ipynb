    "When the square root of a number is a whole number, this number is called a perfect square. 9 is a perfect square because $\\sqrt{9}$ = 3. Not all square roots are whole numbers. Many square roots are irrational numbers, meaning there is no rational number equivalent. This brings us to our task, what is the square root of 2? There is no whole number multiplied by itself that equals two, so $\\sqrt{2}$  is not a whole number. "
